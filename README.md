## **IDNE**: Python package for the paper "Inductive Document Network Embedding with Topic-Word Attention" to appear at ECIR 2020.

### To run the experiments presented in the paper:

You need python 3.7 installed on your computer with pip. Optionally create a new environment (with conda):
    
    conda create --name idne python=3.7 pip
    
Then run (for linux users):

    git clone https://github.com/brochier/idne
    cd idne
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    python scripts/evaluations.py -h
  

### Soon the code will be packaged with a Jupyter Notebook example code...
